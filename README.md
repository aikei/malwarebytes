# Starting

To start the assignment you need to have docker installed (with docker-compose). To start, clone the repo and then run:

```bash
./start.sh
```

On a unix-like system, or

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

On a windows system.

Wait for everything to start and then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

# Notes

I used redux as the state management solution for this assignment. The database used is `elasticsearch v7.17`(it's part of the docker-compose). To get state updates which happen in another instance of the app, websocket connection is used (via `socket.io` lib).

I haven't fully implemented authentication, but I use login request to get accessToken from the server, which is used to uniquely identify the app instance later.
